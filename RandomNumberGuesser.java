/*
 * Class: CMSC203 CRN 21076
 * Instructor: Khandan Monshi
 * Description: Build an application that will receive a guess and report 
 * if your guess is the random number that was generated.Â  
 * Your application will narrow down the choices according to your 
 * previous guesses and continue to prompt you to enter a guess until you 
 * guess correctly.
 * Due: 09/28/2022
 * Platform/compiler: Eclipse
 * I pledge that I have completed the programming 
 * assignment independently. I have not copied the code 
 * from a student or any source. I have not given my code 
 * to any student.
